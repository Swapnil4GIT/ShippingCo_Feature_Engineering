# Shipping_Feature_Engineering
Perform Feature Engineering on Shipping Company dataset of logistics

For this shippping company we are trying to extract different features by doing feature engineering.

Problem Statement:
1. What is the correlation between actual_distance_to_destination and actual_time
2. What is the correlation between osrm_distance and osrm_time
3. What is the correlation between segment_osrm_distance and segment_osrm_time
4. What types of trips are more? Carting or FTL
5. Which source state has the highest number of trips
6. Which source state has the highest number of FTL trips
7. Which source state has the highest number of Carting trips
8. Which destination state has the highest number of trips
9. Which destination state has the highest number of FTL trips
10. Which destination state has the highest number of Carting trips
11. Which source city has the highest number of trips
12. which source city has the highest number of FTL trips
13. Which source city has the highest number of Carting trips
14. Which destination city has the highest number of trips
15. which destination city has the highest number of FTL trips
16. Which destination city has the highest number of Carting trips
17. Is the mean start_scan_to_end_scan same as od_time_diff?
18. Is the mean actual time and osrm time same?
19. Is the mean actual time and segment actual time same?
20. Is the mean osrm distance and segment osrm distance same?
21. Is the mean osrm time and segment osrm time same?
